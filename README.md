As I continue to sharpen my skills as a DevOps Engineer, Iâ€™ve been practicing how to structure Terraform projects the same way companies manage production-ready infrastructure.
Instead of lumping everything into one flat project, I adopted a modular + environment-based approach. This ensures:

ðŸ”¹ Reusable Modules :
 Separate modules for VPC, EC2, RDS, and S3. Each module is cleanly defined with main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf, making them reusable across environments.

 
ðŸ”¹ Environment Isolation :
Dedicated folders for dev, stage, and prod, each with its own:
    â€¢ main.tf (calling modules)
    â€¢ terraform.tfvars (environment-specific configs)
    â€¢ backend.tf (remote state setup with S3 + DynamoDB locking)
    â€¢ variables.tf & outputs.tf
      
      
ðŸ”¹ Scalability & Security :
Dedicated backend.tf for remote state and terraform.tfvars for environment-specific values

ðŸ”¹ Consistency via tfvars : 



The project structure::
